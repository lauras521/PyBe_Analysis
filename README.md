# PyBer Ride Share Data by City Type
## Overview
PyBer is a ride sharing app company valued at $2.3 Billion.  I have been tasked with analyzing ride share data for different city types (i.e. Urban, Suburban, and Rural) to understand trends and see if we can help improve access and affordability to ride-sharing services for underserved neighborhoods.  Separating our ride share data into the city type categories mentioned above and reviewing driver and cost data for these areas over time will help us determine if we can make changes to benefit the business and our customers.  

## Results
The table and chart below showcase the differences between city types.  

* Urban Areas make up the following 
     * 68% of the total rides
     * 81% of the total drivers
     * 63% of the total fares
      
* Suburban Areas make up the following 
     * 26% of the total rides
     * 16% of the total drivers
     * 31% of the total fares

* Rural Areas make up the following     
     * 5% of the total rides
     * 3% of the total drivers
     * 7% of the total fares

* The total rides and total fares have similar representation by city type, but rides are less expensive in urban areas than rural areas so drivers make more money per ride in a rural area over an urban area.
     * The average fare per ride in an urban area is $10 (29%) less than the average fare per ride in a rural area
     * The average fare per driver in an urban area is ~$40 (72%) less than the average fare per driver in a rural area
* Over the timeline examined in 2019, urban areas always produced more fares than suburban areas and suburban areas always produced more fares than rural areas.

## Summary
After review of the data I recommend the following:
1. People living in rural areas might be drawn to be drivers due to the high payoff per ride.  We could put some recruiting effort here. 
2. However, along with recommendation 1, if more people start driving in rural areas, the fare per ride should decrease.  If there aren't events to get more people riding in rural areas this might benefit the rider but the drivers might become less excited due to the revenue drop. 
3. Cities will continue to provide us the most fares.  Based on population density, there will always be a high demand for drivers in cities, so continuing to make sure drivers are available here will be important for our bottom line.
